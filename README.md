# DRS-HTE-RCT


This repository contains code to reproduce the simulation study of disease risk score (DRS) methods for assessing heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE) in randomized controlled trials.

---

## Repository structure

- **`scripts/`** – main analysis scripts and plotting scripts.  
   Start here if you want to reproduce results. See the [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) for details.  
- **`functions/`** – helper functions used by the scripts.  
- **`results/`** – output directory.  
  This is generated automatically when scripts are run and is empty in the public repo (except for a the README.md file).  

---

## Notes

- This is the **public version** of the code. Exploratory and archived code has been excluded for clarity.  
- Data are **simulated** within the scripts; no real patient data are included.  
- Results (CSV/PDF files) are generated locally when scripts are run and are not tracked in the repository.

## Requirements

This project uses an **R environment managed with [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/)** to ensure reproducibility.  

- To set up the same environment used for the simulations, run:  

```r
install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
